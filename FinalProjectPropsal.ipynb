    "\n",
    "Background and Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "    Donald Trump’s election into the White House as the U.S. The President has sparked a lot of controversy over \n",
    "    the course of the past four years. Trump’s political approach, strategies, and personal views and opinions \n",
    "    have been at the heart of such controversies. Trump, unlike previous presidents, has also been vocal about\n",
    "    his ideas and political views (such as his support for building a wall along the U.S.A and Mexico border) on \n",
    "    the social media app Twitter. The most significant thing about Trump’s use of Twitter is that he is able to \n",
    "    voice his thoughts publicly for all to see without the public having to wait for speeches or large announcements\n",
    "    on television. We are able to get an immediate look into what Trump’s position is on any given topic or issue.\n",
    "    Not only that, but Twitter’s character limit forces Trump to make his thoughts more concise, there isn’t much\n",
    "    room for him to draw out his thoughts or avoid certain aspects of a question. He’s also unable retract what \n",
    "    he said without it being screenshotted, saved, etc. by others who have already seen the tweet before it was \n",
    "    deleted. With that in mind, Trump’s availability on Twitter makes it that much easier for us to get even more\n",
    "    insight into exactly what kind of person he is, specifically by looking at the vocabulary used in his tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Using Trump’s tweets we can look at the types and lengths of words he uses to determine what kind of person \n",
    "    and president Trump is. We are curious to know how much of Donald Trump’s tweets consist of words or phrases \n",
    "    with negative connotations (such as “disgusted,” “attack,” “crime,” etc.). We also want to look at his tweets \n",
    "    to see how much of a boastful president he is and whether or not the words he uses in his tweets are used to \n",
    "    invoke fear and aggression from or towards the people. Analyzing Trump’s tweets will allow us to look at his \n",
    "    outlook as President over the past four years and whether or not his tweets have become more positive or \n",
    "    negative. Recently Trump has been put up for an impeachment trial for the obstruction of power and has \n",
    "    continued tweeting to voice his sentiments on the matter. However, the targets of his tweets and the words \n",
    "    he uses in his tweets may have become significantly more negative than those during the first year of his \n",
    "    presidency [2]. But that makes us wonder if he has become a more confident and prideful president towards the \n",
    "    end of his term than he was at the start of his term.      \n",
    "\n",
    "    Linguists and other data analysts have done similar projects in which they analyze Trump’s tweets to see the\n",
    "    effectiveness of his words and the level of vocabulary he uses [1]. Other studies have also looked at how \n",
    "    positive or negative Trump’s tweets tend to be. A few of the studies, namely Michael Tauberg’s “Analyzing \n",
    "    Trump’s Tweets” analysis, looked at exactly who the tweets were directed towards. Tweets with the most negative \n",
    "    words were targeted at specific individuals [1]. Trump’s tweets also contain a lot of attacks towards other \n",
    "    political groups, organizations, and even television programs [3]. Positive tweets could be directed towards what\n",
    "    he agrees with, while negative tweets could be for policies he disagrees with or disapproval of his presidency.\n",
    "    However, none of the studies have analyzed Trump’s tweets to look at the nature of the tweet as there’s a \n",
    "    possibility that Trump’s tweets that contain mostly positively connotated words, but the nature of the tweet \n",
    "    itself could be sarcastic.     \n",
    " \n",
    "    Analyzing Trump’s tweets to look at his outlook as president and who he targets most is important not necessarily\n",
    "    because we want to know about his personality, but because it may be useful for future presidents who may consider\n",
    "    using Twitter as a way to reach the public in a more relevant and convenient way. The tweets can be used to see \n",
    "    what demographics respond to his tweets the most, what his target demographic is, who his followers are, etc. \n",
    "    The findings from the tweet analysis can help to create different political strategies for a more relatable, and\n",
    "    inviting approach as president. Alternatively, a harsher, more carefree attitude used to tweet can also be an \n",
    "    appeal for a different group.\n",

    "Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "    We believe that a sentiment analysis of Trump’s tweets will yield overwhelmingly negative results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data \n",
    "    The ideal data set would include all of Donald Trump’s tweets (the text) and the time and date they were posted\n",
    "    since he became president because we’re trying to analyze what the sentiment of his tweets reveals about his \n",
    "    political ideology and approach. We want the data set to be big enough so that we don’t focus on only a certain\n",
    "    time period which may give us skewed results. An ideal data set would give us all the tweets Trump tweeted since\n",
    "    he became president and be as updated as possible in terms of when the data was collected. This data would be \n",
    "    collected using Twitter’s API so that we can get accurate and up to date records. It would also be useful to \n",
    "    collect data from his deleted tweets which would more accurately depict what people see on the daily basis rather \n",
    "    than just what he decides to keep up. We want to make sure this data collected is reliable meaning there’s no\n",
    "    blank columns to when/ what was tweeted for a certain row. We can just store this data in a csv file or json file\n",
    "    for the data we get from the api to then run our analysis of what words are used the most and what that signifies. \n",

    "\n",
    "    Permission to use this data / use it for this purpose.\n",
    "        Currently awaiting approval for api access from twitter. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Privacy concerns regarding datasets and/or terms of use for compliance.\n",

    "Potential biases in our datasets.\n",
    "    Potentially there could be biases based on how the program identifies and classifies words into what we are looking\n",
    "    to infer. We should be careful not to write the program in such a way to look to prove our hypothesis, but to let \n",
    "    the data speak for itself. It could be easy to make the data fulfill our own expectations. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    We should also keep in mind that Donald Trump's tweets may not always be his own and that could skew that data, \n",
    "    especially since we have no real way or weeding it out which ones may not have been written by him. \n",
    "    For example, On June 18, 2019, USA Today released an article stating that Scavino is the one who writes Trump's \n",
    "    tweets. To date, Scavino is the longest-serving aide in the Trump Administration.\n",

    "    what one of the teammates is doing, gently bring it up with them personally outside of the group chat. Do not be\n",
    "    passive aggressive. If you have a problem, it will be addressed with sensitivity and honesty. \n",

    "* Help One Another: If someone needs help, doesn’t understand a concept, or know how to execute code, make them feel \n",
